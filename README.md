# ScoreKeeper
Basic functional score keeper.
This project is merely just a small, unappealing, but functional score keeper (named for ping pong but can really be used for mostly any games where scores need to be kept between two players).
The functionality allows for
                            The total score to be reached to be adjusted (e.g first to 5, first to 6 etc)
                            Depending on the player who wins or loses, the color of their score will either change green or red once the game is over.
                            Score keeper can be reset.
                            Functional buttons to increase selected player's score by 1 point.
